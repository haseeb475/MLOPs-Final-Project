# Car Price Prediction Model

This project implements a logistic regression model to predict car prices based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset of car data and provides estimates for car prices based on the input features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the [Car Price Dataset]. The dataset contains information about various cars, including features such as mileage, horsepower, number of doors, fuel type, etc. It also includes the corresponding car prices.

## Model Development

The logistic regression model is built using the scikit-learn library in Python. The steps involved in developing the model are as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - The dataset is loaded and cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
   - Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical representations.

2. Feature Selection:
   - Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, or domain knowledge are used to select the most relevant features for the model.

3. Model Training:
   - The preprocessed dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - The logistic regression model is trained using the training data.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - The trained model is evaluated using the testing data.
   - Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's performance.

5. Model Deployment:
   - Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for making predictions on new, unseen car data.

## Usage

To use the car price prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Run the `car_price_prediction.py` script, providing the necessary input data.
   - Input data should be in the same format as the training dataset, with the appropriate feature values.
   - The script will load the trained model and generate predictions for the car prices.
